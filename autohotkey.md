Autohotkey is a great application that lets you create shortcut for many things.

Read and agree to the license agreement, once there is no continue button you can close out of the setup software!

##Making a script
To make a script just **right-click** a location(eg: Desktop) and select Autohotkey Script (.ahk)
Right click the file and select "edit" to edit the file.
Double click it to run.

##Text-shortcuts
To troll a scammer you can set up a mini text-shortcut script. So when for example the letter "a" is pressed it is replaced with "b".
To do this you simply copy this script:

::_Text to be replaced_::_Replacement text_

You can put multiple lines of code into one .ahk file!
Note: A script only works as long as it is running!
