## Reasons
One of the reason that we recommended these OSs because they support TeamViewer and easy to use (not always). However, we do believe that those scammers can use any remote software that they want because today many software developers aim to support as many OSs as possible.

You can install it on a VM. Again, NEVER LET STRANGERS REMOTE CONTROL YOUR COMPUTER.
