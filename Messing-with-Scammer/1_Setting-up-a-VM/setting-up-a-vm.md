## Note
Before even starting this tutorial make sure that your PC has 8 GB or more of RAM.
This can work with less though so give it a try!

We will not send you any link direct to the malware nor pirated software nor the fake syskey or whatever. It is against the GitHub TOS and illegal in some parts of the world (some parts, I hope). Do not ask for the these stuffs.

## What is a VM?
A VM (Virtual Machine) is basically a PC inside of your PC. In this virtual PC you can install any programm or remove any file without damaging your actual physical PC.

### Always use a VM when dealing with tech-support scammers!!
Never grant a scammer access to your physical Computer. They might install viruses or destroy your PC. Always let them use your VM.

## Setting up with VirtualBox
First of all you need to download a program called [Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

On the website select: VirtualBox _version_ for _Your OS_ hosts

and click the link next to the text.

## Installation
Open the downloaded installation file and follow instructions given by it.

## Downloading your OS
At this point you should have already downloaded your OS.
In case you haven't [here](/1_Setting-up-a-VM/Downloading-OS.md) is a guide

## Creating a VM
Open Virtual Box and click on "New" (Top-left)

Copy the following information into the popup:

Name: _OS Name_
Type: _OS Type_

Version: _OS Version_ (_architecture of your PC_)

For memory size devide your physical PC's RAM by two and enter that number into the box.

**Note: This is MB not GB. 1GB=1024MB**

Now select "Create virtual hard disk" and choose VDI at the next step.

After clicking Next select Dynamically allocated and hit Next again.

Since this is an AntiScammer PC, you are not going to need alot of storage space on it. So I would recommend about 16-32GB of space.

At the top of the popup click on the little folder icon and select a place where you want to store your pc. **(Tip: put it in the same folder as the OS file)**

Then click Create.

To install windows 10 click [here](#installing-windows-10)


## Setting up with Parallel Desktop

## Setting up with VMWare Workstation/Player

## Setting up with VMWare Fusion


### Installing Windows 10
Open the folder in which your Windows copy is in.
Double click the .iso file. (In case that doesn't work you can always right click and select the first option)

Now on the left side of the File Explorer there should be a new drive in your PC named something like (F:)

Remember that letter.

Back in Oracle Virtualbox select your VM on the left side of the Window and click the green "Start" arrow located over it.

Now there should be a popup in which you have to select the drive with the letter that you remembered earlier.

When you click continue or whatever positive option there is, you should see a Windows logo.

Follow basic instructions by the installer.

**(If you are asked for a product key click "I don't have a product key" and then select Windows 10 Home and click continue)**

Then click "Custom" and continue.

**Tip: Copy your VM incase a scammer ruins it! Always have a backup**
In VMWare Workstation you can create snapshots, basically a point in time that you can always jump back to.
