#How to download a OS

##What is a OS?
A OS or "Operating System" is used to run a PC. Eg: Windows 10, Mac OS X Mountain Lion, etc

##Downloading Windows 10
**Note: To do this legally, you need to have windows 10 already installed on your PC!**

[Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) the Media Creation tool by Microsoft and run it.

Read the license agreement and click Agree.

Then select the second option "Create installation media for another PC"

Click continue until the download starts.

After the download you need to locate the file on your PC. (Tip: Put the file in a new folder called OS, so you can find it later!)

##Downloading OS X/macOS
Well, you can't. Apple does not give the installation ISO for free.

If you have a Mac, download the version of the OS X from Mac App Store, use [DiskMaker X](http://diskmakerx.com/) to create installation media (to either USB or DVD) then install it.
