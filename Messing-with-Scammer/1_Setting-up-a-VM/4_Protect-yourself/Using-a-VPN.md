#How to use a VPN

##What is a VPN?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a network that you can connect with wirelessly. When you live in location "A" and the VPN is located in location "B" then every Website will think that you are now at location "B" (Where the VPN Server is set up). Basically your location can not be tracked down!
