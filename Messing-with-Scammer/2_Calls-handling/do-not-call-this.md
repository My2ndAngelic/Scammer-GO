Remember, not all number are stay in the line constantly. Some number could be assigned to a scammer and revoked, and then assigned to a legitimate company, which will receive prank call constantly.

I checked (personally) with my intelligent network to give these number as a (temporary) DO NOT CALL LIST.

And again, the number could be revoked and given to another one again, and again, and again. So do expect that another scammer will use this number again.

And finally, please ensure your report is correct. If not, close that immediately.
