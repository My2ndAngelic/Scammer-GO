# HOW TO CHECK NUMBER
This guide will guide you through step by step how to verify the number yourself. DO CHECK THE NUMBER BEFORE YOU CALL.

If you receive a call from that number, DO CHECK A NUMBER BEFORE CALLING BACK. There is also a chance of scammer will spoof that number.

## Step 1: Scammer BLACKLIST
If they do, move to step 2, if not you may want to stop. There is a high chance that the number belongs to an innocent. If there is a scam report, you may continue, otherwise, just stop.

## Step 2: Google
Search for the organization that the number belongs to. If that number really belongs to a real organization, STOP IMMEDIATELY. You don't want to be ask by the officers for prank calling, do you?



## Step 3: Test call with them, ask them some innocent question
> Is this tech support company?
> I got virus on my computer.
> A pop-up say that I have to call your number.
> Somebody call me this morning and ask me to call you back in around x hour.

Now what? Wait for the answer. If they told you wrong number, move to step 4.

Warning: If you suspect that the scam is something else (IRS Scam, Tax Scam, Unpaid bill scam), you should know what to do.

## Step 4a: Sorry them
...like you were calling to a wrong number, and hang up. That is be a legitimate organization/person. Also, sorry for disturbing them.

## Step 4b: Let them fix your VM first
Always, let them do with your VM. If they show you REAL PROBLEM of your VM or do nothing to your VM, move to step 5a. If they show you some bullsh*ts, like tree scan and tells you that is a virus, or/and ask you to pay with credit card, move to 5b.

## Step 5a: Thanks them
Because they are nice person. DO NOT ACCUSE THEM BEING SCAMMER WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE.

## Step 5b: Do something
Because this one is a scammer. It time to piss them off and/or tell them to stop scamming people.
