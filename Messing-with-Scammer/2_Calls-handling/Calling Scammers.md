#How to call a Scammer

##Google Hangouts
I personally recommend [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) to call scammers. Google Hangouts lets you call most US numbers for free. Since Scammers's numbers
are mostly from the US that's the perfect way to go!
**Note: You need a Google Account for this to work. The scammer will not see your email address**

When you are on the website just simply click on "Call" and enter a Scammer Number.

##Skype
Just create a Skype/Microsoft account and use Skype on Web/Skype on Desktop to call them.
